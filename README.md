# ![Infopark](https://raw.github.com/infopark/rails_connector_legacy_features/master/infopark.jpg) Rails Connector / Legacy Features

We have been doing some cleaning and removed a number of infrequently used features from the
[Rails Connector](https://rubygems.org/gems/infopark_rails_connector) gem.
Most of the projects used to build their own version of the removed features.

The removed features are:
* Comments
* CrmFromController
* LinkHelper
* Liquid Templates
* MenuHelper
* MicronavHelper
* Ratings
* RssController
* SearchController
* SeoHelper
* SeoSitemapController
* Timemachine
* TrackingHelper
* UserController

These features are still available as source code at:
https://github.com/infopark/rails_connector_legacy_features

If an application of you depends on these features and you wish to continue using it,
you can use the feature's source from the
[archive](https://github.com/kostia/rails_connector_legacy_features/archive/master.zip)
in your application.
